# PitchShiftPA
Phase-Aligned Pitch and Formant Shifter

Phase Aligned Wavepacket (Re-)Synthesis (PAWS) pseudo-UGen, allowing for manipulating pitch and formant structure of the sound independently. This allows e.g. shifting pitch while maintaining the formant structure, or changing the formant without changing the pitch.

Distributed as a Quark for SuperCollider.
